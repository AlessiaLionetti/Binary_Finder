## BINARY SUBSTRING PRIMARY FINDER

This is the initial part of a group project undertaken on during my 1st Year at the university in the module of algorithm and data structure. 
This project implements a multi step algorithm in Python to analyze a given binary string. It extracts all possible substrings, converts them to decimal, filters for prime numbers below a specified limit, and returns a specific, sorted subset of those primes.

We have not chosen my code for the further implementation of the coursework (as we presented 4 of them) but I think it is worth it to share it with the world!  

## Project Structure
- Extraction of substrings
- Check if given number is prime
- Handling errors
